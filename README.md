# GLOVi Glove
The Gesture Layout Observation Via Impedance (GLOVi) Glove was designed as an open-source data capture glove specifically designed for intuitive control of the HANDi Hand and may be also useful in other applications where quantification of finger flexion/extension movements is necessary. The inexpensive design allows low capital investment for pilot research studies or hobby projects, making it possible to provide proof-of-concept without investing in more robust or capable data capture gloves.

## Build your own GLOVi Glove
The GLOVi Glove consists of off-the-shelf potentiometers, electronic hardware, easy-to find materials, and custom 3D printed parts. Instructions for building the hand and setting up the servos will be available in the near future, and will be your main go-to document while printing and building the glove.


* __3D Print Files:__ The folder that contains the raw STL files as well as the .THING and .x3g files for 3D printing on a Makerbot Replicator 2. NOTE: The STL files have been adjusted to print with proper tolerances in the PLA material. Further, the print orientation is important for many of the files; refer to the .thing files provided if printing .STL files with other softwares besides MakerWare to ensure the proper print orientation.
* __STEP Files:__ This folder contains the STEP files for each of the parts used in the hand, which should be importable into most 3D CAD softwares.
* __Arduino Sketches:__ This folder contains Arduino sketches that are used for controlling the HANDi hand. They can also be used as a basis for your own sketches should you be using the GLOVi Glove for some other purpose.

* __Bill of Materials:__ a detailed list of the off-the-shelf materials and parts required to build the GLOVi Glove. Note: We have listed the distributors that we have used in the past as a point of reference, but be aware that there are multiple distributor options for each part and that we do not endorse the listed distributors in any way.
